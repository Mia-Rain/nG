nG
-- A base for xbps 100% GNU free
-- nG is not an actual distro but rather a write up
-- on the requirements for setting an xbps system 100% without GNU
-- nG only provides the basics for avoiding GNU
-- while creating a base xbps chroot
---- See `./deplist` for a list of dependencies + there replacements
---
Setup
-- 1 start by creating a new folder "somewhere" (the folder is called <ROOT>)
-- 2 steal a copy of the go compiler from alpine (see `./deplist`) and add it to your PATH
-- 3 make sure a posix shell is present on the host system
-- 4 compile/obtain a copy of bmake
-- 5 obtain a copy of the kati source code 
-- 6 enter the folder of said source code and apply `./make.patch` using patch
-- 7 compile kati via `bmake kati` (requires go and ninja (see `./deplist`))
---- This will produce a `ckati` binary, it can be used as a replacement for (GNU)make
---- With the following flags
---- `ckati --ninja --ninja_dir=build --regen --use_find_emulator --color_warnings`
------ This requires a `./build` folder; and produces a `<>/build/ninja.sh` script
------ Run said `<>/build/ninja.sh` script to compile (GNU)make projects
-- 8 compile/obtain a copy of busybox (requires (GNU)make; use ckati; see above)
---- Set it's prefix to <ROOT> when compiling; otherwise install to <ROOT>/(usr/)
-- 9 compile/obtain a copy of musl (requires (GNU)make; use ckati; see 7)
---- Set it's prefix to <ROOT> when compiling; otherwise install to <ROOT>/
-- The above creates a stage 0 system
---- Below will be for compiling xbps; static xbps can be used
